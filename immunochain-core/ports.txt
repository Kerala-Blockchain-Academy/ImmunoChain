RabbitMQ
    IP: <address of machine running rabbitmq>
    15672:  HTTP API clients, management UI and rabbitmqadmin
    5672, 5671: used by AMQP 0-9-1 and 1.0 clients without and with TLS

validator
    port: 4004
          8800
          5050
    Port 4004 is used by rest-API, Transaction Processors (settings TPs also).
    Port 8800 i used for the connection between different validators, in other words to make validator network.
    Port 5050 is used by consensus engines to connect to validators.


Trasaction Processors (TP)
    port 4004 of validator is used.
    We have two chains(beneficiary and vaccine chains) and 4 sample nodes.
        Hence we have 4 sets of, 
               1)Beneficiary settings TP(ben-settings-tp-*)
               2)Beneficiary TP(ben-tp-*)
               3)Vaccine settings TP(vac-settings-tp-*)   and 
               4)Vaccine TP(vac-tp-*)
        All these containers are connected to port 4004 of their respective validator containers with IPs,
            ben-tp-0 : tcp://ben-validator-0:4004
            ben-tp-1 : tcp://ben-validator-1:4004
            ben-tp-2 : tcp://ben-validator-2:4004
            ben-tp-3 : tcp://ben-validator-3:4004   
            vac-settings-tp-3 : tcp://vac-validator-3:4004
            ben-settings-tp-2 : tcp://ben-validator-2:4004   and it continues for other TPs as well.
    
    The settings TP also follows a very similar way of port connection. 


Consensus Engine(pbft)
    port 5050 of validator is used.
    Consensus engines are plugged into port 5050 of the validators. We have 4 consensus engines each 
    for beneficiary and vaccine chains.

rest-API
    port: 8008

    port 4004 of validator is used.
    We have 4 rest-APIs, each for beneficiary and vaccine chains, and are conneceted to their respected 
    validators using IPs such as
        vac-rest-api-0 : tcp://vac-validator-0:4004
        vac-rest-api-1 : tcp://vac-validator-1:4004 
        .
        ben-rest-api-3 : tcp://ben-validator-3:4004
    
    To view & use rest-API of Beneficiary chain, the url : http://localhost:8008/
    To view & use rest-API of Vaccine chain, the url     : http://localhost:8009/



NOTE: The ports for internal connections need not be exposed.
      But ports for external connections, for example by rest-APIs(port 8008) will not work if they aren't exposed.
